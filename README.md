# Community Olympic Festivals Project

##  Project Overview
The **Community Olympic Festivals** project aims to empower sports fans to organize local Olympic Games in between two international editions. By providing a user-friendly digital platform, we facilitate community engagement and promote the Olympic spirit at the local level.

## üéØ Objectives
- Create a platform that allows users to easily organize and manage local Olympic festivals.
- Enhance community involvement in sports and promote healthy lifestyles.
- Provide tools for event creation, participant management, and social media integration.

##  Features
- **User Registration and Login**: Secure user accounts to manage events.
- **Event Creation**: Users can create festivals with customizable details (name, date, location, activities).
- **Festival Chats**: Options for users to chat about the event.
- **Deleting festival Chats**: Access to deleting chats.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Users can provide feedback to improve the platform continuously.

##  Setup Instructions
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nyagooh/the-olympics.git
   cd the-olympics
    ```
## Steps Taken:

### Ideation Phase

The ideation phase involved brainstorming and generating creative ideas that address the needs of sports fans and athletes who wish to organize local Olympic Games. This process was essential for identifying user pain points and opportunities for enhancing the festival experience. 

#### üåü Key Aspects of the Ideation Phase:

- **User-Centric Approach**: 
  By conducting workshops and interviews with potential users, i gathered insights into their expectations and challenges.

- **Diverse Techniques**: 
  I utilized various ideation techniques, such as mind mapping and role-playing scenarios, which helped in exploring different perspectives. This diversity ensured that the final concepts are robust and cater to a wide audience.

### Prototyping

Once ideas were generated, prototyping allowed us to create tangible representations of those concepts. Prototypes  ranged from low-fidelity wireframes to mid-fidelity interactive models.

####  Key Aspects of Prototyping:

- **Iterative Design**: 
  Prototyping was an iterative process where feedback from usability testing informed subsequent versions.
- **User Testing**: 
  By testing prototypes with real users, i  observed interactions and gathered qualitative data on their experiences. This feedback was invaluable for refining features such as event creation forms or social media sharing options.

### Animation

I Incorporated animation into the platform which significantly enhanced user experience by making interactions more engaging and intuitive.

#### Key Aspects of Animation:

- **Visual Feedback**: 
  Animations  provided visual cues that helped users understand system responses. 
- **Dynamic Content**: 
  Using animations to present information dynamically kept users engaged and reduce perceived wait times. 

###  Usability Testing

I conducted usability testing with five participants to gather feedback on the wireframe prototype. Below are key findings and suggested iterations based on user feedback.

#### üîë Key Learnings:

- **Navigation Clarity**: Users found some navigation elements confusing when moving between creating an event and reviewing details. 
- **Input Fields**: Several participants expressed uncertainty about required fields versus optional fields during event creation. 
- **Social Media Integration**: Users were unclear on how to share events on social media; they suggested clearer prompts or buttons. üì±
- **Visual Design**: Feedback indicated that while the layout was generally appealing, some users felt that certain sections were too cluttered. 
- **Error Handling**: Participants noted that error messages were not clear when they tried to submit incomplete information. ‚ö†Ô∏è
  

####  List of 5 Main Iterations for Next Version:

1. **Improve Navigation Flow**:
   - Simplify transitions between sections by adding breadcrumb navigation or clearer back buttons. 
   
2. **Clarify Input Fields**:
   - Differentiate between required and optional fields with visual cues (e.g., asterisks or color coding). 

3. **Enhance Social Media Sharing Options**:
   - Add prominent sharing buttons with tooltips explaining their function to make social media integration more intuitive. 

4. **Refine Visual Design**:
   - Reduce clutter by consolidating similar information into collapsible sections or tabs to improve readability. 

5. **Strengthen Error Messages**:
   - Revise error messages to provide specific guidance on what needs to be corrected before submission.
